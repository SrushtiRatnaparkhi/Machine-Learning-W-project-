This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning algorithms using Python, organized in a modular and object-oriented manner. It includes classes for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Polynomial Regression, and Fully Connected Neural Networks. Each algorithm-specific class inherits from a common root class, showcasing code reuse and maintainability through inheritance. The module.py file contains all the classes and their implementations, with each child class extending the functionality of the root class. This project emphasizes the principles of modularity and object-oriented design, making it easy to manage and extend the codebase.
